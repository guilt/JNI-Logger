JNI Loggers
-----------

JNI Implementation of some popular logging frameworks.

The idea is to be able to use a native appender, with minimal
configuration. This allows us to look at how fast we can log data
natively. 

How to Build
------------

The distribution is very compact, and building the distribution is
very easy.

```
$ ./gradlew test
```

That's it.

Limitations
-----------

This is purely experimental code. Unless you are willing to donate
your working setup to science, beware.
